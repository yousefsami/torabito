              <h2>ACCOUNT SETUP</h2>
              <p>
                To use the Platform, you need to set up a
                <i>Torabito IOT Dashboard</i> account. You may establish either
                a free account (“Free Account”) or a paid account (“Paid
                Account”). You are authorized by
                <i>Torabito IOT Dashboard</i> to set up one Free Account only.
                <i>Torabito IOT Dashboard</i> reserves the right to terminate
                any additional Free Accounts set up by you and any Free Accounts
                that have been inactive over 6 months. When you create an
                account, we collect registration-related information such as
                name, address, e-mail and phone number. Once you submit the
                required registration information, we alone will determine
                whether or not to approve your proposed account. If approved,
                you will be sent an e-mail detailing how to complete your
                registration. For so long as you use the account, you agree to
                provide true, accurate, current, and complete information which
                can be accomplished by logging into your account and making
                relevant changes directly. You are responsible for complying
                with these Terms when you access this Website, whether directly
                or through any account that you may setup through or on this
                Website. Because it is your account, it is your job to obtain
                and maintain all equipment and services needed for access to and
                use of this Website as well as paying related charges. It is
                also your responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of your
                password(s), including any password of a third-party site that
                we may allow you to use to access this Website. Should you
                believe your password or security for this website has been
                breached in any way, you must immediately notify us.
                <i>Torabito IOT Dashboard</i> or our billing processors collect
                your billing information when you upgrade to a Paid Account. All
                of this registration information is protected in accordance with
                our Privacy Policy.

                Website and the Platform which are described fully on our
                pricing page. By providing a payment method, you expressly
                authorize us to charge the applicable fees on said payment
                method as well as taxes and other charges incurred thereto at
                regular intervals, all of which depend on your particular

                Paid Accounts can be month-to-month, yearly, or another duration
                described more fully on our pricing page. For Free Accounts, the
                subscription period is month-to-month unless earlier terminated
                as provided in these Terms. Paid Accounts are subject to fees
                based upon the account type you've selected. For renewals,
                <i>Torabito IOT Dashboard</i> will automatically charge your

                FOR YOUR INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AND FOR ADDITIONAL
                SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS UNTIL YOUR ACCOUNT IS CANCELED OR
                TERMINATED. PLEASE PRINT OUT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR YOUR
                RECORDS. RENEWAL/CANCELLATION Paid Accounts will automatically
                renew for the same Subscription Period unless you cancel the
                account by the end of the then-current Subscription Period. You
                can cancel your account at any time by contacting customer
                service at support@<i>Torabito IOT Dashboard</i>.com.
                Cancellation will be effective immediately. Please note that
                after you cancel your account, you will not be able to use or
                access the Platform and you will not be entitled to a refund of
                any fees that you've paid.

                We control and operate the Website from our headquarters in the
                United States of America and the entirety of the Website may not

                RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER. Please Read
                This Provision Carefully. It Affects Your Legal Rights. This
                provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any
                dispute (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class
                Action Waiver clause below) that may arise between you and us.
                Effectively, then, “dispute” is given the broadest meaning
                enforceable by law and includes any claims against other parties
                relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such
                as our licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors)
                whenever you also assert claims against us in the same
                proceeding. This provision provides that all disputes between
                you and us will be resolved by binding arbitration because
                acceptance of these Terms constitutes a waiver of your right to
                litigation claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or
                jury. We prefer this because we believe arbitration is less
                drama-filled than litigation. To be clear, there is no judge or
                jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is
                limited. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award
                the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s
                fees). YOU AND <i>Torabito IOT Dashboard</i> AGREE THAT, EXCEPT
                AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE,
                WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN
                THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND
                FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN
                ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.
              </p>
              <h2>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</h2>
              <p>
                For all disputes, you must first give us an opportunity to
                resolve the dispute which is first done by e-mailing us at
                support@<i>Torabito IOT Dashboard</i>.com the following
                information: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written
                description of your claim, and (4) a description of the specific
                relief you seek. If we do not resolve the dispute within 45 days
                after receiving your notification, then you may pursue your
                dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your dispute in a court
                only under the circumstances described below.
              </p>
              <h2>Arbitration Procedures</h2>
              <p>
                If this provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as
                provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or
                we may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American
                Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS,
                www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all disputes, and the
                arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The
                arbitration will be commenced as an individual arbitration, and
                will in no event be commenced as a class arbitration. This
                provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable
                arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action
                procedures or rules apply to the arbitration. Because this
                Website and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal
                Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all
                disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable
                substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable
                statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit. You or we
                may initiate arbitration in either Georgia or the federal
                judicial district that includes your billing address. In the
                event that you select the latter, we may transfer the
                arbitration to Georgia so long as we agree to pay any additional
                fees or costs which the arbitrator determines you incur as a
                result of the transfer. So long as you place a request in
                writing prior to commencement of the arbitration, we will pay
                all arbitration fees and associated costs and expenses. But, you
                will still be responsible for all additional fees and costs that
                you incur in the arbitration which include but are not limited
                to attorneys’ fees or expert witnesses.
              </p>
              <h2>Class Action Waiver</h2>
              <p>
                Except as otherwise provided in this provision, the arbitrator
                may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not
                otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative
                proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated
                action or private attorney general action) unless both you and
                <i>Torabito IOT Dashboard</i> specifically agree to do so
                following initiation of the arbitration. If you choose to pursue
                your dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration
                Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not
                apply to you. Neither you, nor any other user of this Website
                can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise
                participate in a class, consolidated, or representative

                You understand and agree that by accepting this provision in
                these Terms, you and we are each waiving the right to a jury
                trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. If any clause
                within this provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause
                above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will
                be severed from this provision whose remainder will be given
                full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is
                found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire provision will
                be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court.

                us or our affiliates and your discontinued use of this Website.
                Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
                we agree that if we make any change to this provision (other
                than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such
                change and require us to adhere to the language in this

              <p>
                We think direct communication resolves most issues – if we feel
                that you are not complying with these Terms, we will likely tell
                you. We may even provide you with recommended necessary
                corrective action(s) if possible. However, certain violations of
                these Terms, as determined by us, may require immediate
                termination of your access to this Website without prior notice
                to you. The Federal Arbitration Act, Georgia state law and
                applicable U.S. federal law, without regard to the choice or
                conflicts of law provisions, will govern these Terms to the
                fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Except for disputes
                subject to arbitration as described above, any disputes relating
                to these Terms or this Website will be heard in the courts
                located in Fulton County, Georgia. Except as otherwise set forth
                in the dispute resolution provision, if any of these Terms are
                deemed inconsistent with applicable law, then such term(s) will
                be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no
                other terms will be modified. By choosing not to enforce any of
                these Terms, we are not waiving our rights. These Terms,
                together with our Privacy Policy, End User Agreement and the
                Data Processing Addendum (as applicable), contain the entire
                agreement between you and us and, therefore, supersede all prior
                or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements
                between <i>Torabito IOT Dashboard</i> and you about the Website
                and our services. The rights of
                <i>Torabito IOT Dashboard</i> under our Terms will survive the
                termination of our Terms.

                  data (including data about users' interactions with our
                  service). These Service Providers may have access to your
                  personal or other information in order to provide these
                  functions. In addition, some of the information we request may
                  be collected by third party providers on our behalf. We
                  require our Service Providers to agree to take reasonable

                  investigation of potential violations thereof; to protect the

                  in litigation in which we are involved, as part of a judicial
                  or regulatory proceeding. Business Transfers. We may engage in
                  a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution,

                  typically one of the business assets that is transferred or
                  acquired by a third party. If we are acquired by or merged
                  with another company, if we sell or transfer a business unit
                  or assets to another company, in the unlikely event of a
                  bankruptcy proceeding, or as part of any other similar

                  occur. Aggregate or De-identified Information. We may disclose
